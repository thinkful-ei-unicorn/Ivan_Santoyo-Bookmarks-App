Ivan Santoyo Bookmark App

This app is made to store, display, and filter web bookmarks.

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain: title, url, link, description, rating 1-5

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a link I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

I can select from a dropdown menu a minimum rating to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the selection.
